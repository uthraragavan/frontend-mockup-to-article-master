You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?
  
I studied HTML5 and a few new tags such as <footer>,<sup> and <sub>. Also, I got an idea about how to resize images if I resize browser screen or open the window from a mobile device. I learnt about how to translate a mockup screen to an HTML page.
* What has been easy?

Finding the asociated tags to achieve the effects was easy.
* What has been difficult?
  
Identifying the aspects such as font-size and font-family from the mock-up screen was difficult.
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


Yes. I referred to MDN and w3schools websites to research about the necessary HTML tags and designing page to adjust various screen sizes.
